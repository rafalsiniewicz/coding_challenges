### Conclusions 
1. Use dict to store number of occurences if you have big array with repeating values
2. Dicts (O(1)) are way faster in searching, adding elements than lists (O(n))
3. Generally if you have a big array of some values which may repeat, then always use
dict to store those values and number of their occurences
