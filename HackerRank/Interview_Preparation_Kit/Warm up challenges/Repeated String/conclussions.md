### Conclusions 
1. Remember about modulo operator ```%``` if you need to divide number and get total number and the rest
2. Avoid calculation complexity (double or more loops, etc.). Try to use at max. 1 loop
3. Write universal solutions!!!
4. Think how program will work for big input, e.g. 1000000000000 loops (maybe you can isolate corner cases?)
