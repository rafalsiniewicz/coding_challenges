### Conclusions 
1. If you have a task in which you have levels and the object can move up or down then its good to represent its path 
with -1 (down) or +1 (up) numbers. Then the object can move on y axis only by +1 or by -1
2. ALWAYS try to represent the description and requirements with numbers, so it can be computed easier
