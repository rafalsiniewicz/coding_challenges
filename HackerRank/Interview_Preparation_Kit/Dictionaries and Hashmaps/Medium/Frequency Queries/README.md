You are given  queries. Each query is of the form two integers described below:
-  Insert x in your data structure.
-  Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present.
-  Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly . If yes, print 1 else 0.

The queries are given in the form of a 2-D array  of size  where  contains the operation, and  contains the data element.

Example

The results of each operation are:

Operation   Array   Output
(1,1)       [1]
(2,2)       [1]
(3,2)                   0
(1,1)       [1,1]
(1,1)       [1,1,1]
(2,1)       [1,1]
(3,2)                   1
Return an array with the output: .

Explanation 2

When the first output query is run, the array is empty. We insert two 's and two 's before the second output query,  so there are two instances of elements occurring twice. We delete a  and run the same query. Now only the instances of  satisfy the query.
