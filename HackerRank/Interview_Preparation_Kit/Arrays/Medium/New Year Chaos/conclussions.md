### Conclusions 
1. PAY ATTENTION TO computational complexity!!! Avoid nested loops. Use 1 loop at max.!!! 2 loops means at least ```O(n^2)``` complexity!!!
2. Create copy of array/object you'll make changes/remove elements, etc.
3. PAY ATTENTION to **corner cases!!!**
4. Computational complexity is the amount of resources required to run algorithm. But particular focus is given to **computational time**.
