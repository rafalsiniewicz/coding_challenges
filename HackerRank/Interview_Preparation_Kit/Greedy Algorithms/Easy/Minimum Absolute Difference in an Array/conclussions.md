### Conclusions 
1. Avoid O(n^2) or worse time complexity- its always insufficient!
2. Using sorting algorithms can be really useful in some tasks! Use merge sort or
quick sort for sorting arrays!
3. Sometimes sorting data before doing actual task can be really helpful, consider
case in which you would have data sorted and if it would help you doing task
4. its easier for you to implement quick sort with low, high parameters in function
