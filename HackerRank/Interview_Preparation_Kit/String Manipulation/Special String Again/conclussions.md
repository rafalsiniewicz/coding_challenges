### Conclusions 
1. Avoid `O(n^2)` or worse time complexity!!!
2. Sometimes solution can be found in "brute force" way, without any "hack". Such
solution can be complicated and have many corner case "ifs", but its time complexity
can be much less than `O(n^2)`
3. Try to iterate list only once or if you have to have 2nd loop make it run under
some condition (if not met then break) then the time complexity should be in most
cases much less than `O(n^2)`
