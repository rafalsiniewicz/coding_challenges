# Instruction
Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

If you know the person's name (e.g. if they're named Do-yun), then you will say:

One for Do-yun, one for me.
If you don't know the person's name, you will say you instead.

One for you, one for me.
Here are some examples:

Name	Dialogue
Alice	One for Alice, one for me.
Bohdan	One for Bohdan, one for me.
One for you, one for me.
Zaphod	One for Zaphod, one for me.
