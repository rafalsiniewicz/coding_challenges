# Conclussions
1. To create a list comprehension you can use `for` keyword followed by generator and a `do` block which creates new values from enumerable:
```elixir
for n <- [0, 1, 2, 3], do: n + 1
# => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
2. Comprehensions can also have filters. If value in enumerable doesnt pass filter then its not included in final list:
```elixir
for n <- [0, 1, 2, 3], n > 1, do: n + 1
# => [3, 4]
```
3. You can declare more complicated comprehensions over several lines:
```elixir
for {atom, number} <- [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4],
    rem(number, 2) == 0 do
  atom
end
# => [:b, :d]
```
4. You can create multi-dimension lists (e.g. cartesian product) by using multiple generators. Each value generated by the first generator will be paired once with each value generated by second generator:
```elixir
for x <- [0, 1],
    y <- [0, 1] do
  {x, y}
end
# => [{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}]
```
It works analogically for more dimensions

5. You can access maps field by `[]` or `Map.fetch/2` or `Map.get/3`
6. You can declare mutliple filters by using comma separator:
```elixir
for x <- [0, 1, 2],
    y <- [3, 4, 5],
    x < 1,
    y < 5 do
    {x, y}
end
```
