# Conclussions
1. Each resistor has a resistance value
2. Resistors are colored basing on their resistance value. They have color-coded bands to denote their resistance value. Each band has a position and a numeric value
3. The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.
4. You can use map as enum (enum like in C++, so an object/attribute which stores incremented value, like: Monday (1), Tuesday (2), etc.)
